## Applications FAQs

- **Will users be able to access applications outside Red Hat VPN?**

  Yes

- **How do I know my application is secured if it's accessible outside VPN?**

  Your application is required to be authenticated by Red Hat SSO. The network security layer filters the incoming request that secures the application.

- **Is Preprod also accessible externally?**

  Preprod is under Akamai Preprod lockdown and as such is not accessible outside Red Hat VPN. It can only be accessed internally using the squid proxy. For details about Squid Proxy, you can reach out to the DXP DevOps team.
