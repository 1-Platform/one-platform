# FAQ

> Can API Catalog be used to create OpenAPI Schema for a REST API?

Right now API Catalog doesnâ€™t support schema creation. Developers need to provide a URL that contains the schema hosted somewhere. API Catalog uses that to monitor and provide tools that use the schema.

> What are the API types supported by API Catalog?

API catalog supports both REST and GraphQL APIs. We provide tools based on these two.

> Our team has multiple APIs. Does API catalog support grouping?

Yes, API catalog has something called namespace to allow grouping. Your team can be considered as a namespace and add multiple types of API to that namespace.
