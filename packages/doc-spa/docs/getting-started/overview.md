One Platform provides a single place for all internal applications and services, supports consistent User experience by providing standard platform for service hosting and data integration, efficient resource management, real time metrics availability, cross-team collaboration and unified documentation.

## Why One Platform?

If we observe a few key challenges of any organization with regards to application platforms for developers, it is to provide consistent app development, deployment & delivery experience, and a single place to access information. This could be due to a lack of a shared services platform for developers and unawareness of similar app's availability (search) that invites major duplication of code and efforts.

The One Platform team was developing a solution to this problem since the start of this year. The goal was to build a shared services platform that helps developers to increase the development speed using easy to integrate microservices, in-built SPAs, and simplest components library and provide seamless app delivery. The intent is to provide a platform that connects users, developers, and stakeholders across the organization and allows them to exchange value by sharing apps.

Developers have good reasons to select many feasible platforms that provide good development and deploying experience and One Platform works with these platforms and respective tools to ease a developer's job even further. While One Platform provides integrations and microservices that save developers time and effort, developers can use saved time to strengthen the core functionality of their individual apps.

## One Platform Benefits?

One Platform has been built on one key Principle/Mantra i.e. Develop fast, Deliver faster

One Platform does not interfere in the Developer's business and provides flexibility to develop an app using their favorite framework, language, and tools. It provides on-demand integrations with internal tools and applications to easily access/share content(s). The following diagram shows where One Platform really comes into the picture.

The applications deployed in One Platform are,

1. Open to all, by choice
2. Hosted apps under single domain i.e one.redhat.com/yourapp
3. Easy to search (including app contents) using common search service
4. Have access to Core microservices (we will discuss them in detail in the next part)
   - Authentication - Red Hat Single Sign-On enabled. (Subject to IT regulations)
   - Authorization - Rover integration to view & grant users access
   - Feedback - Collect feedback in 3 clicks, Generate ticket (Jira, GitLab) for improvements
   - Notifications - Inter SPA communication, Toasters, Banners, Subscriptions etc
   - Search - App & Content search utilizing inbuilt integration with Apache Solr
5. Deployable within minutes using SPAship.
6. Patternfly compliant and can easily utilize One Platform Component library

In the end, One Platform would like to change the developer's mindset through its services from **"I work on a product/process"** to
