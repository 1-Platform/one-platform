One Platform is an internal Application Hosting Platform. It provides a single place for all internal applications and services which supports a consistent user experience by providing a consolidated standard platform for service hosting and data integration, efficient resource management, real time metrics, cross-team collaboration and unified documentation.

<!--truncate-->

True to the core One Platform philosophy, the One Platform documentation and blog platform has been developed as a Single Page Application hosted on One Platform using [SPAship](https://spaship.io). This SPA has been developed using the [Docusaurus v2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) React Framework which supports creation and maintenance of documention and blog post via [GitHub-flavored Markdown syntax](https://github.github.com/gfm/) and also provides extended support for writing JSX and using React components within the Markdown using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).
