# FAQ

> Who are the App Service APIs for?

The App Service APIs are for any developer who wants to use the metadata of an app they have registered on the One Platform.

> Can anyone create an App? How do I create a new App?

Yes. Anyone can create an app as long as you have an internal Red Hat account (i.e. as long as you are a Red Hat employee).

To create a new App, it is recommended to use the [Developer Console](https://one.redhat.com/console) as it provides a graphical interface for quickly and easily creating an app/project on One Platform.

> I already have an app created, can I still register an existing app?

Yes. If you want to integrate your app with any of the One Platform Microservices, registering your app in the Apps Service (via the Developer Console or the Apps Service APIs) is the easiest way to do so.
