### Other Details Pages

### Landing Page

The Homepage for Analyst Papers App.

It shows the recently added documents in a grid view, with a search bar and some filters to sort and filter through the documents.

### Search

When a user enters a search query in the search bar and submits, the app performs a search across PNT Portal and/or Google Drive (as per the selected filter), and shows the search results in a grid view and the search keywords are highlighted.

### FAQs

* Where is data/documents in the Analyst Papers coming from?
    The Analyst Papers app has custom integrations with PNT Portal, and Google Drive which allows it to fetch and search for Analyst Papers documents. For PNT Portal, it searches the documents from the ‘Analyst Materials’ table. And for Google Drive, it performs the search in the "Researches in One Platform" shared folder.

* How frequently is the data on the Homepage updated?
    The Homepage shows the documents from a cache stored in the Analyst Papers backend. The cache is updated every day to check for new document additions/removals. But unlike the homepage, newly added documents are searchable almost immediately. So they show up in search even though it doesn’t show up on the homepage.
