Apps Service is the indexing service which allows you to create and manage individual apps/projects on One Platform. It provides CRUD operations for the app metadata.

## Getting Started

Any developer can use the Apps Service to view the metadata for their apps, and to configure the One Platform Microservice integrations.

To get started with the Apps Service, follow the steps below:

1. Register your app on the [One Platform Developer Console](https://one.redhat.com/console)
2. Setup an API Key for your app/project
3. Now you can use the API Key for authenticated access to the One Platform API Gateway to access the GraphQL APIs
