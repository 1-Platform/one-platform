2. Update Search Index
3. Delete Search Index
4. Read Search Index

#### Apps using this microservice

* All Native and Non native SPAs

### Quick Start Guide

3. Version control system required. Preferably **git**.

#### Steps

1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/1-Platform/one-platform).

```sh
git clone git@github.com:1-Platform/one-platform.git
```

2. Switch the working directory to the user microservice

```sh
cd one-platform/packages/search-service
```

3. Install the microservice dependencies.

```sh
npm i
```

### Start

1. Run npm start:dev to run your microservice for dev env and npm start for production env.
2. Navigate to port 8080 to see the microservice.

eg: http://localhost:8080/graphql

### Build

1. [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is used for the build system in the microservices.
2. Run npm build:dev to generate a build for dev env and npm build for production build.

### Testing

1. For testing microservice with [supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest) with the preconfigured settings.
2. Test related environment configurations are present in .test.env under the e2e folder.
3. Execute the command for testing.
