We are happy to announce the One Platform GA release i.e. [one.redhat.com](https://one.redhat.com) that now hosts all Platform inbuilt SPAs and One Portal legacy SPAs.

Since last month the team has been working on One Portal migration and the new infrastructure setup. During this time we created new environments, migrated One Portal SPAs to the[/legacy](https://one.redhat.com/legacy) subpath and the requisite backend services.

There were a few resultant yet expected issues discovered (listed below) after the completion of the migration activities that we would be closing by November 6th. We would also be reaching out to individual stakeholders to share more information regarding their SPAs in the next week.

Next week?

- [beta.one.redhat.com](https://beta.one.redhat.com) deprecation.
- MoD Handover, RHEL Developer Guide migrations and Research Repo SPA Deployment to [stage.one.redhat.com](https://stage.one.redhat.com) and [one.redhat.com](https://one.redhat.com).
- Feedback SPA fixes. (Note: You can still submit the feedback)
- Fix UI issues and known issues.

Known Issues?

- Optimize legacy SPA for faster loading and legacy APIs - [ONEPLAT-797](https://projects.engineering.redhat.com/browse/ONEPLAT-797)
- Show a loading message on the legacy SPA - [ONEPLAT-796](https://projects.engineering.redhat.com/browse/ONEPLAT-796),
- CSS for Fallback URLs  page needs to be fixed [ONEPLAT-798](https://projects.engineering.redhat.com/browse/ONEPLAT-798)
