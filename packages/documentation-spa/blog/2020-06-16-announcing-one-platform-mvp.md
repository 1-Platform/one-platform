We are happy to announce the One Platform MVP release with limited alpha versions of Microservices and some of the inbuilt Single Page Applications (SPAs).

This MVP was focused on building a backend infrastructure to support One Platform, some basic frameworks and features of Microservices, inbuilt SPAs, and SPAship implementation to deploy the SPAs.

## MVP Highlights

- One Platform limited alpha with services such as SSO Authentication, Notification Framework, Feedback and User & Group microservices; which covers most of the basic requirements of currently deployed SPAs.
- Notifications Framework for configuring Email or Push Notifications; and a Feedback service with Jira integration.
- Default One Platform chroming template for Global Navigation Header with the ability to view all the deployed SPAs and Notifications.
- Default Feedback button on all pages, for gathering quick feedback from users.
- SPAship implementation for faster SPA deployments.
- Microservice Architecture using the PSI OpenShift Container Platform.
- GraphQL API Gateway for One Platform Microservices.
- Custom design system compatible with Patternfly 4, to support most SPA requirements and to ensure smooth onboarding.

## Whatâ€™s next

- One Platform User Interface release.
- Continue fixing known issues, enhancements for Chroming templates, and more for the Microservices & inbuilt SPAs.
- Implement a Search Microservice in collaboration with the Search Platform team.
- Create a detailed documentation to onboard new SPAs.
- Prioritize and migrate One Portal modules. Decouple One Portal modules and convert into individual Microservice and SPAs.
- Initiate stakeholder conversations to migrate existing SPAs deployed on other properties. - Understand application requirements and make necessary updates/modifications to One Platform Microservices.
- Continue SPAship onboarding and upgrades, explore other third-party tools and application integrations.
- Create a Component library for One Platform Applications, inherited from Patternfly design system.
