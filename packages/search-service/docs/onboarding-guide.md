## How the Search Indexing and Updation works

With the support of Hydra APIs we have created graphql API ecosystem to manage the data with the Solr.

To Indexing/updating the information push your proposed data with the createUpdateIndex API. If you want to delete the data use the deleteIndex API. For more information please check the API References.
